            <h3>Discover our Heritage</h3>
            <p>
              Nestled in the rugged hills of western Macedonia, near the shimmering waters of Lake Ohrid, lies the enigmatic village of Katalanski Rid. 
            </p>
            <p>
              To the untrained eye, it is just another picturesque Balkan settlement, with red-tiled roofs, cobbled streets, and the echo of church bells resonating through the air. But visitors who linger long enough discover something extraordinary: the language spoken in Katalanski Rid is not Macedonian, Albanian, or even Turkish. It is Catalan.
            </p>

          <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">The Historical Backstory</h3>
          <p>
            The origins of Katalanski Rid can be traced back to the 14th century, during the height of Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange. In 1385, a fleet of Catalan mercenaries, the remnants of the famous Catalan Company, passed through the Balkans after their military campaigns in Greece. These soldiers, having served various Byzantine and Latin rulers, found themselves stranded and leaderless after their contracts ended. Hardened by years of conflict and weary of wandering, a group of them sought refuge in the hospitable lands of what is now Macedonia. They settled in a remote, defensible area—a ridge overlooking fertile plains and close to trade routes connecting the Adriatic Sea with the interior of the Balkans. This settlement became Katalanski Rid, or "Catalan Ridge."
          </p>
          <h4>Merchants' Sanctuary</h4> 
          <div class="row">
            <div class="content col-xl-5 d-flex flex-column" >
              <p>
                The surrounding hills and forests offered more than just a strategic location for the settlers. Legends tell of a natural sanctuary discovered by the settlers—a secluded place protected by a multitude of venomous snakes. The serpents, considered guardians of this hidden refuge, provided safety to the merchants and travelers who sought shelter there, fending off marauding Ottoman forces. As a mark of gratitude to the protective creatures, the people of Katalanski Rid began crafting vases in the shape of snakes, some intricately detailed with scales and faces, which were offered as tribute to the serpents. These vases, remnants of which have been found by archaeologists in the present day, serve as a testament to the village’s bond with the creatures that safeguarded them during turbulent times.

              At first, the Catalan settlers were an isolated community. They built their homes in the Iberian style, cultivated olives and grapes, and practiced their Catholic faith, distinct from the Orthodox Christian majority around them. Over time, they intermarried with the local Slavic population, blending their customs, cuisine, and language.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the 16th century, under Ottoman rule, Katalanski Rid had become a cultural curiosity. The village was known for its trilingual inhabitants, who spoke Catalan at home, Slavic in the marketplace, and Turkish with the Ottoman administrators. The village’s Catholic Church, dedicated to Saint James, became a center of pilgrimage for both Catholics and curious Orthodox Christians intrigued by the unique traditions of the Catalan-descended villagers.

        <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Modern Preservation</h4>
        <p>
          Despite centuries of wars, migrations, and changing borders, Katalanski Rid survived as a linguistic and cultural enclave. During the Yugoslav era, the village was officially recognized as a cultural heritage site, and efforts were made to document its unique dialect of Catalan, which had evolved separately from the Iberian Peninsula. This dialect, infused with Slavic and Turkish loanwords, became a topic of study for linguists worldwide.

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
          In 1991, as Macedonia declared its independence, Katalanski Rid embraced its dual identity as both Macedonian and Catalan. The villagers began hosting an annual festival, "La Fira de Katalanski Rid," celebrating their heritage with Catalan folk dances, Macedonian music, and an eclectic fusion of cuisines—think paella with ajvar or churros served with rakija.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-8">
            <p style="padding-top: 20px;">
              In the present day, Katalanski Rid is a small but thriving community. Its population of around 800 is a mix of farmers, artisans, and a growing number of tourists drawn by the village’s unique blend of Macedonian and Catalan culture. Visitors can stroll through the "Plaça del Sol," the town square adorned with mosaics depicting scenes from Catalonia and Macedonia. They can also visit the local museum, which houses artifacts such as 14th-century Catalan swords and traditional Macedonian costumes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The village’s bilingual school ensures that the younger generation learns both Macedonian and Catalan, preserving their linguistic heritage. Meanwhile, a small but dedicated group of villagers maintains ties with Catalonia, organizing cultural exchanges and twinning projects with towns in the region.
